# Virtual Assistant

This is a simple virtual assistant, the code is written in Python.

I used a wide variety of code libraries such as: speech_recognition, pywhatkit, pyjokes, etc. <br>
In addition, I interfaceed with the 'open weather map' API for information on weather and real-time hours in the world.
